# Kotlin-Game
A 2D top down RPG written in Kotlin

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN MOVED TO https://github.com/Loop312/Bioreign

we are currently attempting to use jetpack compose/compose multiplatform to create the game due to its ease of use and compatibility, this project will remain as a reference for the classes functions and stats being used. additional properties may be added to it in the future so it can  be used as a better reference on a different project
